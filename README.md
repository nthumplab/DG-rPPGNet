# DG-rPPGNet

This repository is the official implementation of *Domain Generalized RPPG Network: Disentangled Feature Learning with Domain Permutation and Domain Augmentation* that has been accepted to ACCV 2022.

## Description

We propose a DG-rPPGNet to generalize the rPPG estimation with different domains.

The proposed DG-rPPGNet including the disentanglement network, domain permutation strategy and augmented domain generalization strategy
